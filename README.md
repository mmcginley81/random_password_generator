# random_password_generator

This random_password_generator will create a secure password between 8 and 128 characters. 
Programmed primarily using JavaScript this application uses arrays and for loops to create
passwords with the options for including numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters as well as symbols.

Originally the program developers wanted this to be created with user prompts but I had issues creating correct prompt answers into my arrays. 
I researched other options and used my tutor and office hours to create something that I think has a better user experience. 
There is a accurate slider for the number of characters and checkboxes for the variable options.

Please see the screenshot of this application in my comments of the ReadMe file on GitHub.
